    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, 
    in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to 
    implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

    Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things 
    on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, 
    and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.

    What Would the Web Look Like Without JavaScript?
    Without JavaScript, all you would have on the web would be HTML and CSS. 
    These alone limit you to a few web page implementations. 90% (if not more) of your webpages would be static, 
    and you'd only have the dynamic changes like animations that CSS provides.
